# Products

The foundation of QTrace is built around the maintainence, tracking, and tracing of Product information.

>**Product**:

Any item (product or service) upon which there is a need to retrieve pre-defined information and that may be priced, or ordered, or invoiced at any point in any supply chain

In more basic terms, a Product is any item that is picked, manufactured, or refined for sale.

In Organizations where administrators have enabled the use of GS1 codes, Products will be identified by an associated GTIN (Global Trade Item Number) code. When GS1 codes are not used, administrators can define one or more custom Product Codes to be used for Product identification. See **Enabling GTIN codes for your Organization** for more information.

In addition to adding Products for your own organization, Product information for both Suppliers and Customers can be added in cases where this has not yet been added to the system.



The Electronic Product Codeâ„¢ (EPC) is syntax for unique identifiers assigned to physical objects, unit loads, locations, or other identifiable entity playing a role in business operations.
