# Products

The foundation of QTrace is built around the tracking and tracing of Product information.

Based on GS1 Standards (https://gs1.org/voc/Product) a Product is defined as any item upon which there is a need to retrieve pre-defined information and that may be priced, or ordered, or invoiced at any point in any supply chain.

In more basic terms, a Product is any item that is picked, manufactured, or refined for sale.

QTrace divides information for Products into two categories:

- **Products that belong to your organization** 

    Users with permission are able to add detailed information for their own organization's products.

- **Supplier Products** 

    Users can add Products for any suppliers added to the system who may not already be registered with QTrace.  When a new contact for a Supplier is added to QTrace, the contact will receive an email notifying them, and also providing them with the option to register their own organization in QTrace to take over the ownership and maintenance of their own Products.

## Product Codes

In Organizations where administrators have enabled the use of GS1 codes, Products will be identified by an associated GTIN (Global Trade Item Number) code. When GS1 codes are not used, administrators can define one or more custom Product Codes to be used for Product identification. See **Enabling GTIN codes for your Organization** for more information.

(See **Product Components** for more details.)

## EPCs

The Electronic Product Code™ (EPC) is syntax for unique identifiers assigned to physical objects, unit loads, locations, or other identifiable entity playing a role in business operations. (See **Events** for more details.)

The Electronic Product Code is a universal identifier for any physical object. It is used in information systems that need to track or otherwise refer to physical objects.

The Electronic Product Code is designed to facilitate business processes and applications that need to manipulate visibility data – data about observations of physical objects. The EPC is a universal identifier that provides a unique identity for any physical object. The EPC is designed to be unique across all physical objects in the world, over all time, and across all categories of physical objects. It is expressly intended for use by business applications that need to track all categories of physical objects, whatever they may be.

Traceability, is defined as the ability to systematically identify a unit of production, track its location and describe any treatments or transformations at all stages of production, processing and distribution.

Product details are manually added or uploaded to QTrace, then items like location, quantity, and generation of EPCs are tracked as Events are recorded in the system.
