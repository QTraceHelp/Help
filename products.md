# Products

The foundation of QTrace is built around the maintainence, tracking, and tracing of Product information.

Based on GS1 Standards (https://gs1.org/voc/Product) a Product is defined as any item upon which there is a need to retrieve pre-defined information and that may be priced, or ordered, or invoiced at any point in any supply chain.

In more basic terms, a Product is any item that is picked, manufactured, or refined for sale.

QTrace divides information for Products into two categories:

- **Products that belong to your organization** Users with permission are able to add and upload detailed information for the products that belong to your organization.

- **Supplier Products** Users can add Products for any suppliers added to the system who may not already be registered with QTrace.  When a new contact for a Supplier is added to QTrace, the contact will receive an email notifying them, and also providing them with the option to register their own organization in QTrace to take over the ownership and maintenance of their own Products.

Product Codes

In Organizations where administrators have enabled the use of GS1 codes, Products will be identified by an associated GTIN (Global Trade Item Number) code. When GS1 codes are not used, administrators can define one or more custom Product Codes to be used for Product identification. See **Enabling GTIN codes for your Organization** for more information.
