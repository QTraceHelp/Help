# Products

The foundation of QTrace is built around the maintainence, tracking, and tracing of Product information.

Based on GS1 Terminology, QTrace considers a Product to be "any item (product or service) upon which there is a need to retrieve pre-defined information and that may be priced, or ordered, or invoiced at any point in any supply chain.)

In more basic terms, a Product is any item that is picked, manufactured, or refined for sale.

In Organizations where administrators have enabled the use of GS1 codes, Products will be identified by an associated GTIN (Global Trade Item Number) code. When GS1 codes are not used, administrators can define one or more custom Product Codes to be used for Product identification. See **Enabling GTIN codes for your Organization** for more information.

Master Item Data is class-level master data corresponding to a GTIN (Global Trade Item Number) or IBM Food Trust Product ID, is generally uploaded by the creator of the trade item in IBM Food Trust

The Electronic Product Codeâ„¢ (EPC) is syntax for unique identifiers assigned to physical objects, unit loads, locations, or other identifiable entity playing a role in business operations.
