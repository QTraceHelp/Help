# Locations

A Location is a specific facility belonging to an organization that has been registered in QTrace.  Although the Locations page is used to add and maintain Locations for your organization, Locations for Suppliers and Customers can also be added in their respective sections of the application.

Location information for all organization types are generally added and maintained by an Administrator, and consists of the following key data points:

Location GLN (Global Location Number) 
Location Address (physical)
Location Type (e.g. farm, warehouse)

The GLN is the GS1 Identification Key used for any location (physical, operational or legal) that needs to be identified for use in the supply chain.

The GLN is a globally unique number that can be used to access master data about a location.

All organisations exchange information in their business processes, externally and internally. The Global Location Number (GLN) makes possible the unique and unambiguous identification of physical locations, operational locations and legal entities.
