# Incidents

Users may need to enter an Incident if a product they received is damaged, defective, or deemed as unusable.  Once this is determined, a new Incident can be entered to send information directly to the supplier/distributor

In order to track and monitor incidents from your community members, you first need to set up each incident as a unique incident type. You can create as many incident types as needed, as well as organize them into categories.
